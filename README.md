### Payfully Test React+Redux
Create an application using create-react-app that will use the Spotify Web API with 3 different
routes,
* the first one should display the user authentication to gain access there and be able to
perform queries.
* The Second view should allow the user to search music in Spotify using the search endpoint.
* The third view should allow the user to view the current track being played with the
authenticated user account.
